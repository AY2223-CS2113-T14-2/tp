## Design & implementation

### Command Mechanisms:
For all valid commands, the mechanism of implementation are as follows:
1. Read input - ```runBagPacker()``` method in ```BagPacker``` calls the ```Parser``` class to read user input command
2. Create command object - The ```Parser``` class creates a corresponding command object of the relevant command
3. Execute command object - ```runBagPacker()``` method executes the ```.execute()``` method (overridden by child classes) of the command object 
   which runs the actual command function

#### Add Command

Add command is used to add a quantity of item(s) to the packing list.

Mechanism: ```AddCommand.execute()``` calls the ```PackingList.addItem()``` method from the ```PackingList``` class which executes the ```ArrayList.add()``` method to add the item to the ```PackingList``` ArrayList. 
It then updates the ```quantity``` variable according to the quantity inputted by the user.


#### Preventing duplicate items

When using the `add` function, we have decided to implement method that checks whether the item with the same name already exists in the packingList.

This is done through the `itemFinder()` method in class `PackingList()`, which is called during `AddCommand.execute()`.

Below is the UML diagram showing what occurs during `add` function when trying to add an item that already exists.

![AddExistingItemDiagram.png](umlDiagrams%2FAddExistingItemDiagram.png)

When `AddCommand.execute()` is called in `BagPacker`, the `PackingList.itemFinder()` method is called.

The `PackingList.itemFinder()` method loops through all items in the packingList, and returns `true` if any of the existing items have the same name as the item to be added, else `false`.

If `PackingList.itemFinder()` returns `true`, method `AddToItemQty(itemName, addQty)` will be called to update the existing item in the packing list by adding the addQty to the current total quantity of that item. 

If `PackingList.itemFinder()` returns false, the item will be added onto `packingList` using `PackingList.AddItem(Item)`.

In both scenarios, the relevant `ui.printToUser` messages (omitted in the sequence diagram for easier reading) will be called to print a message to the user.


#### Delete Command

Delete command is used to delete an item from the packing list.

Mechanism: ```DeleteCommand.execute()``` calls the ```PackingList.deleteItem()``` method from the ```PackingList``` class which executes the ```ArrayList.remove()``` method to remove the item from the ```PackingList``` ArrayList.

#### Help Command
Help command is used to exit the BagPacker application.

Execute: ```HelpCommand.execute()``` prints the following help message.

```
All Commands:
1. add : Adds quantity and name of item to the packing list.
   Example: Example: add 3 /of toothbrush
   Meaning: Meaning: add quantity of 3 toothbrushes to the packing list
2. delete : Deletes an item from the packing list.
   Example: delete 1
   Meaning: removes the first item in the packing list
3. list : List all items in packing list.
   Example: list
4. pack : Adds to the current quantity of items packed in the packing list.
   Example: pack 2 /of 3
   Meaning: packs 2 more quantities of the third item in the packing list
5. unpack : Deducts from the current quantity of items packed in the packing list.
   Example: unpack 1 /of 2
   Meaning: unpacks 1 quantity of the second item in the packing list
6. deletelist : Deletes all items in the packing list.
   Example: deletelist
7. bye : Stops the BagPacker Application
   Example: bye
____________________________________________________________

```

#### DeleteList Command
```DeleteListCommand``` is used to delete a whole packing list in the BagPacker application.

Mechanism: ```DeleteListCommand.execute()``` reassigns the existing ```packingList``` to a new empty ArrayList of Items, thus deleting the ```packingList```.


#### Bye Command
```ByeCommand``` is used to exit the BagPacker application.

Mechanism: ```ByeCommand.execute()``` updates the static boolean ```isBagPackerRunning``` to be false. 
The ```runBagPacker()``` method will continually parse and execute relevant commands (refer to Command Mechanisms in DG) until
```isBagPackerRunning == false``` which occurs upon the execution of the ```byeCommand```.

## Product scope

### Target user profile

BagPacker is for NUS students, in particular, exchange students who travel a lot and want a simple CLI to keep track of their packing.

### Value proposition

BagPacker aims to help busy students simplify their packing process by allowing easy adding of items to pack and record of the items they have already packed so that they can be organised and aboard their travels with ease.
